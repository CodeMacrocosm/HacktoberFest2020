					<h1><div class="colorm">Hi All,</div></h1>
					<div class="colorw">I'am currently a final year engineering graduate specialized in Computer Science, I'have developed many small android app's, and later on learnt the cross platform app development of flutter and developed an app for a company which is used by machinists for their calculations. It is currently released in play store.</div>
					
					<div class="colorw">In my second year of graduation, I had attended a workshop(Training program) on android app development, initially i was not interested in attending, as one of friend had convinced me i did so.
					After attending the training program for a week, I released that this is what i liked, and this is what which was makimg me happy.
				I had developed many small apps at that stage along wirth my friends and even worked on firebase database. Later on i interned in the same company, had developed a trivia(quiz) app, which tests the general knowledge of the users on various domains.</div>

					<div class="colorw">Later, I could'nt do many apps due to lack of time during the college, but in the initial period of the pandemic lockdown I had got an opportunity to build an app for a company, I came to know through the head of our department, I along with friends decided to do it, as we werent doing anything useful at that time.
					We learnt flutter app development, as the client wanted it to be developed in flutter.
				In a period of two months we learnt plenty of things in flutter, soo many APIs, new widgets and finally developed an app for the company, and I myself published in google play store.</div>

					<div class="colorw">I now released and I'am a strong believer of the fact that "What ever happens , happens for good", if on that day my friend would'nt have convinced me to attend the workshop, I would'nt have developed a passion for it.
						And I hope, I develop many more apps and serve my passion.</div>
					 
					 <div class="colorw">Thank you all, for your interest to read my story! </div>
