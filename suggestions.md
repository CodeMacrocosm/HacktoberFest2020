I [Shreya](https://github.com/5hre9a) suggests you to be patient while coding and solving issues to get better results.

I [Rachana] (https://github.com/trachana20) suggests you, If you are new to any domain of the Computer science, and working on a project, its better to do the research on the project by reading relevant books, materials and then start the work. Instead of starting off with the project directly and asking help (or using the already written material) on stackoverflow or github or any other platform for every small doubt, doing this would curb the creativity of individual.
